  This Bot allows to create a verification QR Code, that the user will have to scan on their arrival on the server. Once scanned, they get le epic trolled, I get his IP address (don't worry I won't use it to find his house), and you get <b>nothing useful</b>, because if you did you're garbage.

# Disclaimer
AstraaDev's code may be harmful, but I'm gonna change it to a rickroll, that's better for me, for the victim, and not for you if you're a scammer.
